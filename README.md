> A chrome extension to help you track your favorite cryptos.

## About

This extension was initial put together in about 2 hours, getting started to being in the Chrome Web store.
Since then, I've been working on making the code cleaner and the extension more feature rich. 
I spend a couple of times during the week working on it.

If you'd like to file an issue or feature request, please go to the Issues tab.

## Developing

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

Building for production will copy all the required files to the `/dist` directory.
