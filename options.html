    <h2>Tracking, mining, and privacy notes</h2>
    <p>
        I want to keep this extension as quick, simple, and easy to use as possible.
        <br>
        To keep your safety and privacy, I'm not using any tracking libraries and 3rd party services.
        <br>
        There's only one sort of tracking for this extension, it's the one that the Chrome Web Store
        uses to keep track of how many people use this extension. 
        It does not track how you interact with the extension, 
        it's just a number of active users per week.
        <br>
        You can even see this on the extension page: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/coins/joncmnocnjnffkopobkdnlcaanhbbpki">Chrome Web Store</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        I use no mining or any other sort of resource based harvesting.
        <br>
        If you suspect a website or extension is mining on your computer, use one of these: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/mining%20blocker">Mining blockers</a>
        <br>
        Curious about what a miner would do to your computer? 
        <br>
        I have an experimental page that can show you this: <a href="http://usmanity.com/projects/miner/">Experimental Browser Miner using Coinhive</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because there is no tracking, mining, or other privacy invasive things being used, this extension should be quick as possible.
        <br>
        If you have any concerns, please contact me.
